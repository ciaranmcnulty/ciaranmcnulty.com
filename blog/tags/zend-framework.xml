            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having thought further about <a href="/source/blog/2010/03/frontal-a-new-approach-to-triggering-javascript-behaviour">Frontal, Carl's JS library</a>, I wrote a quick View Helper to make it easier to use it in Zend Framework projects.</p>

<p>It's <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1845336/Frontal-ZF.tar.gz">available to download</a> on Dropbox, it's available under the MIT licence.  I'll bung it up on somewhere like GitHub once I work out how Git works.</p>

<h4>Basic usage</h4>

<p>Before you do anything you'll need to register the helpers in your <tt>application.ini</tt>:</p>

<code><pre>
resources.view.helperPath.Frn_View_Helper = /path/to/Frn/View/Helper
</pre></code>

<p>to get it to output anything you'll need to echo the frontal helper at the bottom of the page:</p>

<code><pre>
...
&lt;?= $this->frontal() ?&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</pre></code>

<p>By default this will echo nothing! Don't panic, it'll start doing things once you've loaded some stuff into it.  The main use-case here is that you're echoing the helper out in some sort of template (Zend_Layout particularly) but pushing configuration into it from your individual views.</p>

<p>Firstly, you can override the path Frontal will use, for instance if there's a page appears under lots of different URLs but you just want one rule that matches it against '/foo':</p>

<code><pre>
&lt;? $this->frontal->location('/foo'); ?&gt;

will output:

&lt;script&gt;
$frn.location('/foo');
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre></code>

<p>Secondly, you can provide some data that frontal might find useful (rather than dump it in global scope).  The data is auto-converted to JSON so it's a fairly nice way of feeding data from PHP to JS:</p>

<code><pre>
&lt;? $this->frontal->data(array('foo', 'bar')); ?&gt;

will output:

&lt;script&gt;
$frn.data(["foo","bar"]);
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre></code>

<p>That's pretty much it for now, but it works pretty well and I'm going to be building it into a work project.</p>

            <link href="/clarifying-javascript-php-communication-using-json-rpc"/>
            <updated>2010-03-15T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/clarifying-javascript-php-communication-using-json-rpc</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I think of myself first and foremost as a PHP developer but serious sites are getting more and more JS-heavy as time goes on so it gets harder (and less pragmatic) to try and avoid dealing with JS<->PHP communication of some sort.</p>

<p>I'm a big advocate of RESTful design so tend to end up attempting to write scripts that do lots of GETs and POSTs (as appropriate) and parsing out whatever custom response format I've decided JSON requests will return.  It feels good - like I'm sticking to my principles and 'doing it right' but it's a long painful slog that can feel like self-flagellation at times.</p>

<p>It's also slow and hard to prototype - it's hard to argue in favour of some abstract design idea when it's making you take forever to generate simple tasks .  Sometimes when I feel lazy what I really want is a way of calling my PHP objects directly from the JS and not worrying about what's happening in the underlying HTTP, and that's what <a href="http://json-rpc.org">JSON-RPC</a> provides.</p>

<p>In this blog I'll be showing some simple examples of JSON-RPC in action but first let's look at the pros and cons.</p>

<h4>Why JSON-RPC is awesome:</h4>

<ul>
<li>It includes basic error handling as part of the protocol</li>
<li>It hides away all the client-server communications from me the developer</li>
<li>It looks a bit like SOAP so is fairly familiar</li>
<li>I don't have to spend time writing RESTful response formats and pondering URLs to get working code</li>
</ul>

<h4>Why JSON-RPC sucks:</h4>

<ul>
<li>It's not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rest">REST</a>ful - requests from the client come in as POSTs to on URL without a clear semantic 'resource' behind it</li>
<li>There may be specifics to the HTTP that aren't covered by the abstraction</li>
</ul>

<p>I suspect a lot of developers reading the lists above will be thinking "hell yeah, sounds good, how can I have it?"</p>

<h4>The protocol</h4>

<p>I won't go into all the ins and outs of the protocol but it's worth taking a quick look.  The basic paradigm is that the server has a bunch of methods that can be called by the client, that take different parameters.</p>

<p>An example request is a POST to the server that looks like this:</p>

<p><tt>{ "method": "greet", "params": ["Ciaran"], "id": 1234 }</tt></p>

<p>This is the PHP equivalent of $server->greet("Ciaran").  The ID parameter is used to match up requests and responses.  The response would look like this:</p>

<p><tt>{ "result": "Hello Ciaran", "error": null, "id": 1234 }</tt></p>

<p>So the result is a string literal with no error conditions - there's not much more to it than that to be honest, aside from error handling.</p>

<p>It would be fairly simple to implement either side of the protocol yourself on a project, but the real strength is of course that once something is a standard, the rest of the world goes to work on it and starts writing up libraries that lazy programmers like us can use! Let's take a look at two libraries, a Zend Framework one on the PHP end and a jQuery one on the Javascript end.</p>

<h4>JSON-RPC in PHP: Zend_Json_Server</h4>

<p><a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.json.server.html">Zend_Json_Server</a> is pretty simple to use, you will need a class that exposes and handles the methods you're going to be using that's properly docblock commented (this is used by the component to see the parameter and return types):</p>

<code><pre>class My_Service_Handler
{
    /**
    * @param string $name
    * @return string
    */
    public function greet($name)
    {
        return "Hello $name";
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can then proxy JSON-RPC requests along into this object using the Zend Framework component, Zend_Json_Server:</p>

<code><pre>
$server = new Zend_Json_Server();
$server->setClass('My_Service_Handler');
$server->handle();
</pre></code>

<p>Now any requests like our examples above will get an appropriate response.  Again fairly straightforward stuff I think, and should be familiar to anyone who's used a SOAP server in PHP.  All of the complexity of decoding the response and encoding the request is handled by the component.</p>

<h4>JSON-RPC in JQuery: zendjsonrpc</h4>

<p>There are a huge number of jQuery plugins to do JSON-RPC, but <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/project/zendjsonrpc">this one is specifically written to work with the Zend_Json_Server</a> so I figured it's as good an example as any.  If you look at the source code of the plugin it's fairly straightforward and I'm sure it'd be easy to write your own if you preferred.  The basic usage is:</p>

<code><pre>
var client = jQuery.Zend.jsonrpc({url: '/path/to/service/handler.php'});
var message = client.greet("Ciaran");
alert(message);
</pre></code>

<p>As you can see, once the client object is constructed with the service URL you as a developer have a local JS object that exposes the exact same methods the My_Service_Handler has.</p>

<h4>Overall</h4>

<p>What I really find attractive about the JSON-RPC protocol is that, well, someone else has implemented it for me in the two components above.  That means that I can stop worrying about AJAX and start pretending that my PHP object is somehow present locally in my JS and that I can just call its methods at will.</p>

<p>That's a really powerful abstraction. No doubt like most abstractions there are places where it leaks around the edges but the simplicity of the idea and the clarity it brings to JS<->PHP communication make it an approach I'll be certainly investigating for my next JS-heavy project.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="figure narrow">
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ciaranmcnulty/3627788423/" title="Cast of Star Trek by CiaranJMcNulty, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3406/3627788423_c757c36050_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="Cast of Star Trek" /></a>
</div>

<p>Like a lot of other people, I've had a love/hate relationship with <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>.  At first I didn't see the point - it was just <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> without the features, then I drank the kool-aid, and fell in love with its simplicity and openness.  Nowadays I've backed off a bit and see it as an interesting social phenomenon that I enjoy being a part of. I'd been meaning to check out the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.service.twitter.html">Zend_Service_Twitter</a> PHP library for a while, but hadn't really thought of an excuse.</p>

<p>  A few weeks back I was unlucky enough to watch Star Trek V and <a href="http://twitter.com/CiaranMcNulty/status/1981914567">tweeted about how crap it was</a>, despite my friend Nick thinking it's the best of the lot. There was a bit of back and forth, so I posted an order for the films, from best to worst.  A few of my friends then did the same, with the hashtag of #startrekrank as a way of identifying the posts.</p>

<p>It struck me that I could somehow aggregate these results using the Twitter API, so I present to you, <a href="http://startrekrank.com/">StarTrekRank.com</a>!</p>

<p>Actually building the site was pretty straightforward.  The Twitter API combined with the Zend library make it pretty simple to perform searches.  I'm generating the rankings using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method#Kemeny-Young_method">Kemeny-Young method</a>, which is fairly processor-intensive - I suspect it's O(n!) for the number of movies - but to my mind produces very fair results.</p>

<p>The way the site operates is to periodically search for #startrekrank via the API, and index any new tweets.  Then if there are some new tweets, the overall ranking is re-calculated automatically.  Finally, the new tweeters get a message sent @them from <a href="http://twitter.com/startrekrank">the 'startrekrank' twitter account</a> thanking them and directing them back to the main site to view the results.</p>

<p>As a voting platform, Twitter is pretty efficient - voters are authenticated via their Twitter account so you know who the votes have come from.  It's only real downside is that a secret ballot isn't very practical. Now clearly this is all just a bit of fluff, but to me it's an interesting illustration of how Twitter's openness and simplicity allow more complex applications to be built on top of it. </p>]]></content>

            <link href="/Simplify-pagination-logic-using-a-custom-zend-paginator-adapter"/>
            <updated>2009-06-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
            <id>/Simplify-pagination-logic-using-a-custom-zend-paginator-adapter</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pagination logic is something that I've found myself redoing a number of times over the years, and each time it's been a relatively fiddly and painful process.</p>

<p>This time around I decided to check out the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.paginator.html">Zend_Paginator</a> component from the Zend Framework, and found the process useful enough to share!  In my case I was using Doctrine to retrieve data from the database.  I'll skip most of the Doctrine-specific stuff, however, as hopefully this will end up as a decent example of how to integrate Paginator with other non-Zend libraries.</p>

<p>When the Paginator is instanced, it's given an instance of an appropriate Adapter and told what the current page is:</p>

<div class="php">
<p><code><span style="color: #000000">
<span style="color: #0000BB">&lt;?php<br />$paginator&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #007700">=&nbsp;&nbsp;new&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">Zend_Paginator</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$adapter</span><span style="color: #007700">);<br /></span><span style="color: #0000BB">$paginator</span><span style="color: #007700">-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">setItemCountPerPage</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span style="color: #0000BB">20</span><span style="color: #007700">);<br /></span><span style="color: #0000BB">$paginator</span><span style="color: #007700">-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">setCurrentPageNumber</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span style="color: #0000BB">2</span><span style="color: #007700">);<br /></span>
</span>
</code></p>
</div>

<p>It can then be used in a View using the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.paginator.usage.html#zend.paginator.rendering">Paginator View Helper</a>:</p>

<div class="php">
<p><code><span style="color: #000000">
<span style="color: #0000BB">&lt;?php<br /></span><span style="color: #007700">echo&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$this</span><span style="color: #007700">-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">paginationControl</span><span style="color: #007700">(<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$paginator</span><span style="color: #007700">,&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #DD0000">'All'</span><span style="color: #007700">,&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #DD0000">'my_pagination_control.phtml'<br /></span><span style="color: #007700">);<br /></span>
</span>
</code></p>
</div>

<p>The view helper is given an instance of the paginator, a pagination style, and a view script to use to render the pagination.  Zend give a few <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.paginator.usage.html#zend.paginator.usage.rendering.example-controls">example view scripts</a> in their documentation.  They're fairly simple in that they access a straightforward API to see which page would be next, previous, and which pages are in the current range.</p>

<p>So, what I needed to do was write an Adapter to work with Doctrine queries. I wanted it to take a query as a parameter and then paginate across the set of results.  This turned out to be pretty simple - the Zend_Paginator_Adapter_Interface that I needed to implement only had 2 methods, count() and getItems().  The finished Adapter looks like this:</p>

<div class="php">
<p><code><span style="color: #000000">
<span style="color: #0000BB">&lt;?php<br /></span><span style="color: #007700">class&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">My_Paginator_Adapter_DoctrineQuery&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #007700">implements&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">Zend_Paginator_Adapter_Interface<br /></span><span style="color: #007700">{<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protected&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$_query</span><span style="color: #007700">;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protected&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$_count_query</span><span style="color: #007700">;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public&nbsp;function&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">__construct</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$query</span><span style="color: #007700">)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$this</span><span style="color: #007700">-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">_query&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #007700">=&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$query</span><span style="color: #007700">;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$this</span><span style="color: #007700">-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">_count_query&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #007700">=&nbsp;clone&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$query</span><span style="color: #007700">;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public&nbsp;function&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">getItems</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$offset</span><span style="color: #007700">,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$itemsPerPage</span><span style="color: #007700">)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$this</span><span style="color: #007700">-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">_query<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #007700">-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">limit</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$itemsPerPage</span><span style="color: #007700">)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">offset</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$offset</span><span style="color: #007700">)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">execute</span><span style="color: #007700">();<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public&nbsp;function&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">count</span><span style="color: #007700">()<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$this</span><span style="color: #007700">-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">_count_query</span><span style="color: #007700">-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">count</span><span style="color: #007700">();<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />}<br /></span>
</span>
</code></p>
</div>

<p>The count() method of course just returns the total results the query would return if run without constraints, while the getItems() method returns the items on the specified page.</p>

<p>Putting it all together, the code in my Action looks like this:</p>


<div class="php">
<p><code><span style="color: #000000">
<span style="color: #0000BB">&lt;?php<br />$query&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #007700">=&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">Doctrine_Query</span><span style="color: #007700">::</span><span style="color: #0000BB">create</span><span style="color: #007700">()<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">from</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span style="color: #DD0000">'SomeTable'</span><span style="color: #007700">)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">where</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span style="color: #DD0000">'someField&nbsp;=&nbsp;?'</span><span style="color: #007700">,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">12</span><span style="color: #007700">);<br /></span><span style="color: #0000BB">$adapter&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #007700">=&nbsp;new&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">My_Paginator_Adapter_DoctrineQuery</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$query</span><span style="color: #007700">);<br /><br /></span><span style="color: #0000BB">$paginator&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #007700">=&nbsp;&nbsp;new&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">Zend_Paginator</span><span style="color: #007700">(<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">My_Paginator_Adapter_DoctrineQuery</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$query</span><span style="color: #007700">));<br /></span><span style="color: #0000BB">$paginator</span><span style="color: #007700">-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">setItemCountPerPage</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span style="color: #0000BB">20</span><span style="color: #007700">);<br /></span><span style="color: #0000BB">$paginator</span><span style="color: #007700">-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">setCurrentPage</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$this</span><span style="color: #007700">-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">_request</span><span style="color: #007700">-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">getParam</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span style="color: #DD0000">'page'</span><span style="color: #007700">));<br /><br /></span><span style="color: #0000BB">$this</span><span style="color: #007700">-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">view</span><span style="color: #007700">-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">paginator&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #007700">=&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$paginator</span><span style="color: #007700">;<br /></span>
</span>
</code></p>
</div>

<p>In the view I use the paginator to render out the pagination widget, but also for the view to obtain the objects it wants:</p>

<div class="php">
<p><code><span style="color: #000000">
<span style="color: #0000BB">&lt;?php<br /></span><span style="color: #007700">echo&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$this</span><span style="color: #007700">-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">paginationControl</span><span style="color: #007700">(</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$this</span><span style="color: #007700">-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">paginator</span><span style="color: #007700">,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #DD0000">'All'</span><span style="color: #007700">,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #DD0000">'my_pagination.phtml'</span><span style="color: #007700">);<br /></span><span style="color: #0000BB">$items&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #007700">=&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$this</span><span style="color: #007700">-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">paginator</span><span style="color: #007700">-&gt;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">getCurrentPageItems</span><span style="color: #007700">();<br />foreach(</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$items&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #007700">as&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #0000BB">$item</span><span style="color: #007700">)&nbsp;{<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: #FF8000">//&nbsp;...<br /></span><span style="color: #007700">}<br /></span>
</span>
</code></p>
</div>

<p>And a very simplified pagination partial would look like this:</p>

<p>Overall I like this way of working, and certainly it was easier to make a new Adapter than I'd feared.  One future possibility is of making individual adaptors for specific queries, as a way of removing the query logic from my contoller.</p>]]></content>

            <id>/keeping-querystrings-clean-with-zend-framework</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm something of a zealot about short, readable URLs.  Most people by now are using server rewrite rules and Front Controllers of some sort to keep the paths in their application sane and legible, but an area that's often overlooked is the querystring, especially after a form submission.</p>

<p>A typical example of a situation with a 'messy' querystring might be a search form on site.  When a form is submitted, all the elements in the form are entered into the querystring whether they're relevant or not.</p> 

<p>That leads to querystrings like <tt>/search?size=&amp;shape=&amp;colour=red&amp;age=</tt>, which would be a lot more legible as <tt>/search?colour=red</tt></p>

<p>On some sites I work with, an 'advanced search form' can have up to 20 elements, all of which might get submitted in one go leaving the search results page with a huge URL.</p>

<p>Aside from an anally retentive need for neatness, the shorter querystrings provide the following benefits:</p>

<ol>
    <li>They are easier to remember.</li>
    <li>They are less likely to wrap when sent in emails.</li>
    <li>The URL is populated with relevant keywords and not the others, so is better for SEO.</li>
    <li>By shortening the URL in this way we ensure there's one canonical URL for every search, which has SEO benefits and can help with aggregating search statistics.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, in the interest of all of the above I've written a Zend Framework Controller Plugin to shorten any GET request that has a querystring.</p>

<p>What is important to note about the plugin:</p>

<ul>
    <li>It takes a flag in its constructor to say whether the redirects used should be permanent or temporary.  This is mainly used for testing.</li>
    <li>The plugin takes effect before any routing is applied, so is about as efficient as a Zend Framework application can be.</li>
    <li>The plugin would be initialised in your bootstrap, by doing <tt>$front->registerPlugin(new Plugin_CleanQuery());</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the source of the plugin, I'm sure the array stuff could be done a bit more efficiently with some combination of <tt>array_filter()</tt> and <tt>array_walk_recursive()</tt> but I'm not convinced it'll be a bottleneck.</p>
