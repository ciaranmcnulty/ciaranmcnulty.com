            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just did a fresh Ubuntu Karmic reinstall after an ill-conceived upgrade to a Lucid Alpha, so I had to try and retrace my fairly muddled steps in configuring iPhone tethering.   

<p>Because I had a fair idea what I was doing this time it was pretty easy, so I figured I'd best document the steps for the next unfortunate soul trying to do the same.  I'd also be interested to hear if the same steps apply to Lucid once it's out of Beta.

<div style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; clear: right"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ciaranmcnulty/4460108683/" title="iPhone tethering by CiaranJMcNulty, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4041/4460108683_bf732c6c7e_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" alt="iPhone tethering" /></a></div>

<p>The first thing to do is get tethering enabled by your operator.  For some reason O2 can only enable it overnight so make sure you get it well before you'll need it.  Once it's enabled, you'll find your phone has a new option under Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Network-&gt;Internet Tethering.  Make sure you turn it on in here and then forget about it - it's only enabled for devices that are paired over Bluetooth or USB so there's not much of a security worry.

<p>The next step is to get the Ubuntu side sorted.  The best bet is to install the Bluetooth Manager widget Blueman, which will replace your existing Bluetooth widget.  Blueman is much better than the default simple widget, but unfortunately either the way the iPhone exposes its network access point is non-standard or it's a bit advanced because the older version of Blueman in the Ubuntu Karmic sources is not capable of connecting - you'll need to install a newer version from Blueman directly.

<p>The best way of doing this is to add the Blueman PPA and install it from them via apt:

<code><pre>
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:blueman/ppa
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install blueman
</pre></code>

<p>I found after doing this the old bluetooth widget was hanging around, but restarting X fixed that.

<p>To make the iPhone discoverable, go to Settings-&gt;Network-&gt;Bluetooth and just leave the page open.  Most phones require you to somehow make your handset discoverable, but Apple decided that it's discoverable just for as long as you're on this page.

<p>Next, pop open Blueman and click search, and you'll see a list similar to this one:

<div><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ciaranmcnulty/4460136087/" title="Blueman by CiaranJMcNulty, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4041/4460136087_5fdd62d92a_o.png" width="407" height="245" alt="Blueman" /></a></div>

<p>Right-click on the iPhone and select Pair, both the phone and the PC will pop up a confirmation code and you should confirm on both that they're the same.  After pairing happens you should be able to right-click on the iPhone in Blueman and select 'Network access point' to connect via it (even if the phone is not on the Bluetooth screen).

<p>As an added bonus, you should find after your next reboot there'll be a new entry in Network Manager next to the available wireless networks called something like 'Network Access Point on <name of phone>' so you can initiate a bluetooth/tethering connection with one click in future without having to run Blueman.

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Being a geek, I play Xbox games a lot.  Being a music lover, I often want to listen to my own music while playing. Being the right sort of geek, my music is all lovingly arranged in iTunes on my Mac.</p>

<p>Windows people have it easy with Xbox.  They install the Windows Media Sharing service, make sure WMP knows about where their music's kept and it just becomes available to play on the Xbox. I had assumed that us Mac users were excluded from such fun, but then I came across <a href="http://www.nullriver.com/products/connect360">Connect360</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ciaranmcnulty/3096962667/" title="Connect360 in action by CiaranJMcNulty, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3049/3096962667_d78b211057_m.jpg" width="240" height="177" alt="Connect360 in action" /></a></p>

<p>Connect360 is a simple enough application to use.  It installs into your system preferences and lets you share music from iTunes, photos from iPhoto and movies from disk.  The configuration is simple - you can allow/disallow different Xboxes and it will sort out your Firewall settings for you on the fly.  The first time I tried to play an AAC file the Xbox had to go to MS to get an updated codec, but aside from that no additional setup was needed on the Xbox - the mac appeared as just another source.</p>

<p>The overall experience is excellent.  I can drop into the Music menu on the xbox in-game and select which tracks to play, without exiting the game.  The games detect when music is being played and drop out their own in-game music but leave any important sound effects playing (at least, this has worked on all the games I've tried.</p>

<p>Less important to me but worth noting is the fact that iPhoto pictures are easy to navigate and come across really well on a big screen.  I experimented a bit with the Movies sharing, it suffers slightly from the fact it shows the video files' filenames rather than reading any metadata like itunes does, but files of formats the Xbox supports played fine across my 100baseT network, even some HD stuff.  It's certainly a viable option for someone who wanted to play videos on their TV and already had an Xbox - my only criticism would be that MKV files are not supported but I expected that's something MS would have to address.</p>

<p> There is a trial version available that's limited to sharing 100 songs, which is a good idea to try out if you're worried about your particular network setup and want to check it'll all work. Overall for the $20 licence fee Connect360 does what it claims to and does it well.</p>]]></content>

    <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ciaranmcnulty/2709794945/" title="Screengrab of my site on iPhone, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3256/2709794945_dfc58b0dcf_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" alt="Screengrab of my site on iPhone" /></a>
    <p class="caption">The unmodified site</p>
</div>

<p>The first thing I should probably mention is that yes, despite <a href="http://ciaranmcnulty.com/blog/2008/06/the-iphone-3g-vs-the-nokia-n95">saying I wouldn't</a>, I got an iPhone 3G relatively soon after release.  I'll skip the reasons why for now, that's for a future posting. Naturally the first thing I did upon getting my iPhone was to plug in my own site's URL into the browser and see how it did - you can see the result in the screengrab.</p>

<p>You know what - it's not bad.  The site looks roughly as it should, and with a bit of zooming and panning around all the content is accessible. However, on first load the text isn't really legible and it's not making the best usage of the limited screen space on the iPhone.  Also, the large header graphic makes loading a bit strenuous over an EDGE connection when I'm not in 3G coverage.</p>

<p>Simon has been blogging recently (<a href="http://pointbeing.net/weblog/2008/06/mobilising-a-website-part-1-the-problem.html">here</a> and <a href="http://pointbeing.net/weblog/2008/07/mobilising-a-website-part-2-strategies.html">here</a>), about 'mobilising' websites (and has written a good article on the subject for <a href="http://phparch.com">php|architect</a>) so it's something I've been thinking about lately and I decided to see what it would take to improve the way the page was rendered on iPhone.</p>

<p>It's important to realise that this is a very niche pursuit.  What Simon's series of articles is talking about is enabling a site to be viewed from <em>any</em> mobile device, which is a very different kettle of fish from just making it work better on a fancy-pants iPhone - this is really just for my own edification.</p>

<p>So, the first thing to do was to look through the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/Introduction/chapter_1_section_1.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002079-SW1">Apple documentation on iPhone web development</a>, which I found was well written and clearly laid out.</p>

<p>The first thing I wanted to do was eliminate a lot of the whitespace on the right of the page.  Adding iPhone-only CSS is done using a CSS3 mechanism called <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">Media Queries</a>.  It's not an Apple-specific technology, it's from the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> and is a generic way of applying complex rules as to which stylesheet(s) a specific device should use.</p>

<p>I wrote a phone-specific stylesheet that normalised the column widths to the same as the content area and removed the header image.  The extra markup in the <tt>HEAD</tt> of my document looks like this:</p>

<p><code class="html">
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" media="only screen and (max-device-width: 480px)" href="/css/iphone.css" />
</code></p>

<div class="figure narrow">
    <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ciaranmcnulty/2709902805/" title="My site on iPhone (better) by CiaranJMcNulty, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3013/2709902805_55a284eab1_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" alt="My site on iPhone (better)" /></a>
    <p class="caption">Reduced to 1 column</p>
</div>

<p>This says the specified stylesheet should only apply to devices that support Media Queries, consider themselves 'screen' devices, and have a screen width of less than 480 pixels.  This obviously applies to the iPhone, but hopefully more and more user agents will support Media Queries - they're a very powerful mechanism for specifying how a site should display on devices with a hugely varied range of capabilities.</p>

<p>With the new CSS applied for iPhone, the site started to take shape.  The content was all in a nice vertical column, but the phone still wasn't displaying the page zoomed-in enough.</p>

<p>One solution would be to change all of the page's sizings in CSS so that it fitted into the iPhone's default 980px-wide zoom level, but this seemed a bit messy as the extra CSS was so far fairly small and clean.</p>

<p>Apple's solution to this a <tt>META</tt> tag to the <tt>HEAD</tt> of your document that specifies what zoom level to use on load.  My content was 516px wide so mine looks like this:</p>

<p><code class="html">
&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=516" /&gt;
</code></p>

<p>You can do a lot with this <tt>META</tt> tag, such a disabling user zoom, but frankly I think it's a horrible solution. </p>

<p>It lacks the granularity of something like Media Queries, so you're left specifying one common viewport for all 'viewport-aware' devices.  Hopefully there will be some way of specifying viewport dimensions in the stylesheet in future, or that I've missed something.</p>

    <p class="caption">The final version</p>
</div>

<p>With this extra bit of information, Safari is now able to render the site in a much more usable form.  The single-column means only a vertical scroll is needed, with the sidebar items relegated to the bottom of the screen.  The text is legible from the offset, and the loading times are severely reduced.</p>

<p>Obviously this is only a simple example, but hopefully it illustrates how a couple of simple steps that you can make fairly harmlessly to your markup, can vastly improve the browsing experience for the iPhone users amongst your audience.</p>  

<p>Whether it's worth the effort for your site is a cost/benefit analysis you'll need to make for yourself, but I strongly believe that technologies like Media Queries will become more and more useful in future, as the current separation between 'computer' and 'mobile' browsers breaks down into a continuous spectrum of PCs, tablets, PDAs and tiny embedded browsers with a massive range of capabilities.</p>]]></content>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few days ago, Apple launched their much-anticipated second revision of the iPhone.  Key amongst its new features are 3G (HSPDA) connectivity and a GPS unit.</p>

<div class="figure">
<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/anwer/2567778438" title="Larger version of the photo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3120/2567778438_c25718cfe6.jpg" width="480" height="270" alt="Steve Jobs announcing the 3G iPhone"/></a>
<p class="caption">Steve Jobs announcing the 3G iPhone</p>
</div>

<p>As a loyal Nokia user as well as a Mac enthusiast, my loyalty was therefore pretty divided.  I was saved from flocking towards the first generation iPhone's hype machine by a reflex reaction of 'if it's not got 3G it can't be any good' and a recent iPod purchase to be bitter about.</p>

<p>I've been happy enough with my iPod and N95 sitting next to each other in my pocket, but the question I've been mulling over the last few days is, would I be happier with one iPhone instead?</p>

<p>I've come to the conclusion that no, the iPhone is not yet right for me, for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Apple 'approval' for third-party apps</strong></p>
<p>Apple are launching an SDK for iPhone but are insisting that they get to digitally sign every app that runs on it.  The Symbian platform my N95 runs is pretty open - any hobbyist can decide to write a bit of software for it and make it available for download. This has given me access to so many quirky little applications, from Emulators to diet trackers to location sensors - I really can't see the same ecosystem flourishing around iPhone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No MMS</strong></p>
<p>This is a fairly bizarre omission for a modern cellphone.  Admittedly I can count the number of MMS I've sent this year on one hand, but I have sent some and I've received a few as well.  I can only presume that people in the US don't use the things, but seriously Apple, WTF?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mediocre camera</strong></p>
<p>2 Megapixels is ok, but I want my phone to be able to fill the breech when I've forgotten to bring my point-and-shoot camera out with me the way my 5Mpix Zeiss-lensed N95 does.  The lack of a user-facing camera has set the cause of video calls/chat back a few years but is less vexing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No modem functionality</strong></p>
<p>It seems that if you own an iPhone, you have a dial-up device capable of connecting to the Internet at near-broadband speeds, but no way of using that via laptop.  In short, that's retarded.</p>
<p>When I go away I use my N95 with my MacBook Pro and browse the web at a pretty respectable 1.4Mbit - the idea that an Apple mobile is less capable of talking to my Mac than my Nokia phone is makes me cringe.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>This might not seem like much, but I can't bring myself to take a step backwards and get an iPhone that can't do some of the things my existing setup does.</p>

<p>It's my fond hope that the third-party iPhone development community flourishes, however, and manages to fill in all these gaps well enough.  I'm unsure how much the API exposes and whether MMS etc. are within the realms of realistic hope, but you never know.</p>

<p class="caption">The N96, coming soon</p>
</div>

<p>In the meantime the N96 is out around August time, and that's what I'm pinning my hopes on.  It does everything my N95 does, and does it in a neater casing and on faster hardware.</p>]]></content>
