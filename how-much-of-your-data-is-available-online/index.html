    <h2>How much of your data is available online?</h2>

    <h3><time>1st October 2008</time></h3>

    <p>One of the emergent web technologies I'm very interested in is the <a href="http://www.microformats.org">Microformats</a> project, a set of ways of making data embedded in HTML documents machie-readable.</p>

<p>Two of the most widely adopted Microformats are <a href="http://microformats/org/wiki/hCard">hCard</a> and <a href="http://www.microformats.org/wiki/XFN">XFN</a>.</p>

<p>hCard is a standardised method for marking up contact data.  the point of it is that if all sites mark up contact data the same way, it's easier to parse.</p>

<p>XFN is all about the relationships between sites, and one of its key features is that it allows you to identify that a set of online profiles all belong to the same person (if they've voluntarily linked them).</p>

<p>I thought I'd take a survey of the data about me that's available publically online and exposed via these two formats:</p>

<table class="data-table">
<thead>
    <tr>
        <th>hCard Field</th>
        <th>Value</th>
        <th>Source</th>
    </tr>

<p>Taken as an aggregated whole, there's a fairly complete set of contact details out there! Personally I don't mind all of this information being out there, but I know a lot of people who would be horrified if they realised how much was already exposed to search engines and other spiders.</p>

<p>What interests me is that all this data is already out there in the wild for a lot of us, it's just not previously been machine-readable.  What's also important to realise is that in today's world of web archives and Google caches, once data is public it's pretty much going to be available forever.  A lot of us provide data to websites without really thinking about how that data will be displayed and used in future.</p>

<p>As more and more of our lives are lived online, we're all going to leave trails like this and will have to start thinking about how to manage it.</p>

<p>One solution is to maintain more than one identity.  XFN allows identities to be consolidated together, but there's no reason they have to be.  If I wanted to, for instance, I could break the XFN links to and from my Flickr account and essentially keep that identity separate in a machine-readable sense.  The use of pseudonyms would come in handy here, for people with less distinctive names.</p>

<p>One way or another though, you need to take the time to think about what you're typing into that registration form, and whether you're happy having it online.</p>
