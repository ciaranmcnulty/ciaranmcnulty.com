    <h2>Back to Blogging</h2>

    <h3><time>5th July 2015</time></h3>

    <p>Wow, it's been a while! I honestly can't believe it's been nearly 3.5 years since I last wrote a blog post. A few things
have happened in that time:</p>

<ul>
<li>I left <a href="http://themill.com">The Mill / Beam</a> and moved to an awesome job at <a href="http://inviqa.com">Inviqa</a>, where I'm now mostly doing training and coaching</li>
<li>I got involved with, and subsequently took over maintainence of <a href="http://phpspec.net">PhpSpec</a>, a tool I thought was really cool</li>
<li>I started speaking at meetups and conferences (I need to find somewhere on this site to store links to videos)</li>
<li>I got married (gearing up for that was the initial reason I didn't have time to write much)</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, my professional life has changed hugely. I guess I'm now back in a place where I feel I can write longer-form stuff
for a blog.</p>

<p>I keep promising work that I'll write articles for either the Inviqa or Sensio Labs UK sites, so will link out to there when
appropriate, but I wanted to have a place I could dash stuff off without editors being involved.</p>

<p>So, I spent this morning switching the site over to the very cool <a href="http://sculpin.io">Sculpin</a>, and started a few draft posts that I'll be pushing
out in the future. At some point I'll rejig the site's layout so it's a lot easier to find older content.</p>

<p>My aim is to produce 1 blog per month. Will I stick to it? Time will tell...</p>
