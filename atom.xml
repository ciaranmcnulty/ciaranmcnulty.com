            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2015 was the year I started submitting papers to conferences to try and get some speaking gigs. I expected to get a few acceptances but the actual response was really amazing.</p>

<p>I'd expected to not be accepted to many, so I applied to most of the conferences I saw that I could make it to. In the end my acceptance rate was about 40% so I ended up at seven conferences throughout the year.</p>

<p>That's not a lot by some people's standards but it made me feel pretty busy, especially as they weren't evenly distributed.</p>

<p>I was going to write about each conference individually but I fell behind, so here's a recap of my year.</p>

<h1>PHPUK, London</h1>

<p>It all started back in Feb at PHPUK, which I wrote about already so you may as well <a href="/speaking-at-phpuk-2015/">read about it in my previous post</a>.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DlgadZLOK-M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Overall it went well, and the positive feedback from this talk is what I credit with a lot of the later acceptances.</p>

<h1>PhpDay, Verona</h1>

<p>PhpDay was my first conference abroad, and was a little nerve-wracking because I didn't know <em>anyone</em> who was going. It was exciting to be invited overseas though, and the idea someone was going to pay for my travel just to hear me speak was really gratifying (although now I think about it that is a very good description of my day job, I guess it's that I was accepted as myself not as a representative of a company).</p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/134281522" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>I decided to do a straight introductory PhpSpec talk, but looking at past talks I felt challenged by a slide-driven format. I think to understand TDD you need to feel the workflow, so I came up with a 'live-coding-like' animation format to show it. It felt like it worked on the day and I was pretty pleased.</p>

<p>Again the talk went well but for me the highlight of the conference was to get to know some of the other speakers a little better. There were plenty of late-night chats in the bar area and the organisers took us to a <em>fantastic</em> restaurant in Verona for the speaker's dinner. It was the first time in Italy for me so trying the delicious real cuisine of the area was great.</p>

<p>The whole conference had a friendly, open spirit that is sometimes missing at the larger conferences and I'm very much hoping to go again next year.</p>

<h1>Symfony Live, London</h1>

<p>It wasn't completely out of the blue that I was accepted, after all I help to organise the conference so a lot of the selection panel were familiar with my work. All I will say though is that I didn't vote for my own talk!</p>

<p>On the tutorial day I co-delivered a DDD workshop with <a href="https://twitter.com/mr_r_miller">Richard Miller</a>. It went well and I really enjoy presenting with Richard - we both don't prepare an over-rehearsed script ahead of time so it adds a certain spontaneity. We also don't mind interrupting or contradicting each other when we're talking which maybe adds an element of performance.</p>

<p>On the main day, what I tried to do with my talk was give an overview of what testing tools were available and which were most appropriate to use in different circumstances.</p>

<p>My agenda was really to stop people asking me 'which is better, PHPUnit or PhpSpec?'.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jINf8_tgjSU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>In the end I felt crammed for time and a bit disappointed with the final talk. It's got stuff in it that's valuable (and certainly got good feedback from attendees) but I felt like the overall structure wasn't in place.</p>

<p>I'm hoping to deliver this again in a modified form in future to have another crack at it.</p>

<p>The conference itself was great as always; the venue we use is in a stunning location and the social was well-attended. Because it was in London it was a pretty familiar environment for me so the main thing was catching up with people from out of town.</p>

<h1>PhpConf.Asia, Singapore</h1>

<p>OK this was an exciting one to be accepted to!</p>

<p>This was the first pan-Asian PHP Conference, ably organised by <a href="https://twitter.com/coderkungfu">Michael Cheng</a>.</p>

<p>There was a live stream of the conference but I've not seen videos yet. I'll post here if one emerges.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CP1660kUcAEYjl3.jpg"></p>

<p>I was very pleased that <a href="https://twitter.com/super_marek">Marek Matulka</a> was also accepted because it meant I had a travel buddy who's similarly obsessed with frequent flying programmes!</p>

<p>The flight to Singapore was long and tiring but the conference was great. It was in the university and was the first time I've seen a conference audience sitting at round tables, dinner-style.</p>

<p>My talk was a reworking of the one I delivered at PHPUK. On reviewing the slides I found I didn't have to change much, I mostly normalised all of the examples into PHPUnit (I had a mix of different tools in the original which people said was hard to follow).</p>

<p>I was pleased with the way it went and I got some very effusive feedback from some of the attendees who'd never got into testing before.</p>

<p>I don't think I made the most of the social side of the conference - the jet lag was too much. If I go again I'll definitely try to arrive a day more earlier.</p>

<p>The hospitality from Michael and the other organisers was excellent - Singaporeans seem to love to eat and we were very generously looked after!</p>

<p>It was really special being at the first of these conferences. A highlight for me was during <a href="https://twitter.com/miss_jwo">Jenny Wong</a>'s keynote she asked people who'd not been to a conference before to stand and it was at least 75% of the audience!</p>

<p>The PHP ecosystem is built on community so this conference could be the start of something big in Asian PHP adoption.</p>

<h1>PHPNW, Manchester</h1>

<p>I'd not been to PHPNW but had heard good things about it from Inviqa people. It didn't disappoint!</p>

<p>I did a half-day tutorial about PhpSpec on the first day, and I used the animated presentation style I developed for my PhpDay talk with some extra exercises.</p>

<p>I was told a few days before the workshop that 20+ people had signed up, but when I arrived there were about 16 desks. I assumed there was some mistake, but people kept coming in until it was standing room only! Luckily an organiser managed to whip up some extra desks and the staff sorted the situation out very quickly.</p>

<p>In the end having that many people doing code kata in pairs was a great experience.</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CQU5bTzWoAIvAu9.jpg"></p>

<p>The talk I delivered on the main day was a new one about <a href="http://everzet.com/post/99045129766/introducing-modelling-by-example">Modelling by Example</a>. I actually had to put it together in a few days due to my bad preparation so the slides aren't very spectacular, but it's a subject that I've been thinking about a lot over the last year so the ideas came out pretty quickly. I've done the same talk since and haven't felt the need to change it very much.</p>

<p>I think this is the talk I felt best about this year; the feedback was really positive and it felt really natural to deliver.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PIhJX4bLy6M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The social side of PHPNW was good; lots of UK folk I know and a few out-of-towners. Again I left thinking I'd not made the most of it, I think I might just need to come to terms with the fact I find it hard to take part in conferences I'm also speaking at.</p>

<h1>True North PHP, Toronto</h1>

<p>I was very pleased to be selected to speak here because it's co-organised by <a href="https://twitter.com/grmpyprogrammer">Chris Hartjes</a> who is a big advocate of testing and we've had a fair bit of Twitter-based interaction.</p>

<p>Was nice to meet Chris but <em>again</em> jet lag and speaking nerves meant I was a bit withdrawn at the social events (at the speakers dinner I was furnished with one of the biggest steaks I've ever seen).</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CTI73eNUYAAKwH6.jpg"></p>

<p>My talk was an introductory PhpSpec talk. I've found that I am familiar enough with the structure of the slide deck that I can deliver the talk in a fairly relaxed way and throw in extra bits and pieces as I go.</p>

<p>My only regret was I scheduled my flights to arrive quite soon before and leave quite soon after the conference, next time I'll try and give it more time so I can actually relax and see some of Toronto.</p>

<p>We were really looked after at this conference, which I really appreciated, including being ferried around between Airport, Conference, Social and Hotel by the friendly organisers. This made a big difference to my anxiety levels!</p>

<h1>PhpCon Poland, Ossa</h1>

<p>I was encouraged to apply to this by <a href="https://twitter.com/cakper">Kacper Gunia</a>, who I used to work with with and helps organise the event.</p>

<p>In the end I did my testing talk from PHPUK and my Modelling by Example talk, both of which went down ok. They didn't need me to talk about PhpSpec because Kacper was doing a talk himself! I went to see it and it seemed good but it was hard for me to tell as he was speaking in Polish.</p>

<p>There was an incident at the start of my first talk that tested me a little - it took about 15 mins to get the projector working at the beginning (it was traced to the power switch being off!) so it was a little uncomfortable standing in front of an audience for that amount of time.</p>

<p>Trying to fix it:</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CTybwGAWEAAoBlJ.jpg"></p>

<p>In the end I was pleased with how I coped; I think at the start of the year it might have thrown me off but I did ok.</p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/154094214" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/154091775" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>The conference was held in a huge hotel out of town; it was a very pleasant place, unfortunately I forgot to bring my swimming trunks.</p>

<p>It's also the first place I've seen the audience of a talk drinking free beers at 10am!</p>

<p>There was less English content than I'd expected (partly because the English talks were scheduled against each other) so I'll definitely consider coming again as a delegate but probably not as an attendee.</p>

<h1>What's next</h1>

<p>After a year of trying it, I'm definitely going to be speaking at more next year.</p>

<p>I think in 2016 I'll try and get to more UK events, especially some of the framework-specific conferences outside my usual area (e.g. Drupal, Magento, Laravel conferences). I'd also like to go to a US conference if possible.</p>

<p>I was disappointed not to be accepted by PHPUK after getting such good feedback last time, but their acceptance process is blind so it's possible I just need to raise my abstract-writing game.</p>

<p>That said, the only conference I'm definitely doing next year is in Belgrade! I'd better start filling in those CfPs...</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone who supported me this year in my conference speaking, especially <a href="https://twitter.com/_md">Marcello</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/everzet">Konstantin</a> and the rest of the community of amazing speakers at <a href="http://inviqa.com">Inviqa</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks also to my wife <a href="https://twitter.com/RosamondMc">Rosamond</a> for not minding the disruption to our own lives <em>too</em> much!</p>

            <link href="/using-the-pebble-time"/>
            <updated>2015-07-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/using-the-pebble-time</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a long time user of the original Pebble, I of course backed the Kickstarter for its successor, the Pebble Time.</p>

<p>I was briefly tempted by the Apple Watch but even though I am a bit of an Apple fanboy the cost was a too high for version one to tempt me. I might jump in on the next generation.</p>

<p>So having had the Pebble for a month now I feel like I can share some of my experiences.</p>

<h2>Looks and Watchfaces</h2>

<p>I really like the styling on the new Pebble Time. The supplied strap is a black rubber thing, but I've switched it for a NATO strap. The face I've mostly been using recently is called 91 Dub v3.0 (pictured below). It's an homage to classic Casio styling, with infinitely customisable colour combinations.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ciaranmcnulty/19836872456/in/dateposted-public/" title="Pebble Time"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/287/19836872456_203c84d678.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Pebble Time"></a><script async src="//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Another recent favourite is <a href="http://www.markspebblefaces.com/marks/trekv3">Trekv3</a>, which is based on the classic Star Trek LCARS user interface concept. I keep that one for my more geeky days.</p>

<p>Overall the thing feels really good. It's plastic rather than metal (a Steel version is forthcoming) but for the price point that feels good. The 30m waterproofing and generally stable build makes me not feel precious about wearing it for most activities (e.g. the washing up).</p>

<h2>Alerts and Notifications</h2>

<p>This is something I was used to from my old Pebble but I have to say it's awesome having all of your notifications and alerts available on your wrists. There's a lot less need to get the phone out of your pocket (or in my wife's case her purse).</p>

<p>The only downside is that people you're speaking to might think you're bored when you keep looking at your watch.</p>

<p>I have to say, having my calendar on my wrist has made my attending-meetings-on-time stat rise from 60% to around 75%!</p>

<h2>Battery life</h2>

<p>This is epic. I effectively don't worry about charge at all. I've been wearing the watch at night (see below) so I don't get a chance to charge it overnight, but that hasn't been a problem at all. I typically get 4-5 days usage before it drops to 10% battery, and I've learned that 10% means I just have to charge the watch some time that day.</p>

<p>Even when the battery hits 0%, the watch fails over to just telling the time.</p>

<p>I've fallen into the routine of charging the Pebble in the mornings when it needs it. If I notice it's on less than 20% when I wake up, I plug it in while I have my shower and breakfast. 40 mins or so later I'm ready for work and typically that means the watch is fully charged. This thing charges <em>really fast</em>.</p>

<p>I've not really needed to take a charger with me for short trips.  On a 2-day jaunt to Munich for work I didn't take the cables and came home with about 40% charge remaining. This lack of charge anxiety is pretty refreshing for a consumer devices.</p>

<h2>Silent Alarms</h2>

<p>I've been using two apps pretty regularly:</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/TgZmTVtfTqo8H2aYnBb8/convert?cache=true&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=720&amp;h=320" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/546047390db50db6e100002b">Gentle Wake</a> is what's been getting me up in the morning. It's a basic alarm clock that supports different schedules for different days, and wakes you up by at first gently vibrating, getting more and more insistent the longer you ignore it.</p>

<p>The other nice feature is that it can monitor your movement for a configurable window of time before the alarm is due, and if you're moving around (and therefore awake) it will go off early.</p>

<p>I've really noticed a difference in how I'm waking up in the mornings since using this; the slight tickle at my wrist is enough to wake me when I'm only lightly sleeping, and on days where I'm sleeping more deeply it ramps up slowly enough that waking isn't a shock.</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.getpebble.com/api/file/sarVHoWoTJijGcvLByCm/convert?cache=true&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=720&amp;h=320" alt="" /></p>

<p><a href="http://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/54a1ba1afc5f23e4c000012d">Timer+</a> is a fairly basic timer. It's main selling point is how simple the UI is, and how easy it is to start a quick timer.</p>

<p>I've been using this for timing cooking, timing talks, timing anything really. Having a silent alarm that doesn't attract anyone else's attention has been generally really useful in a host of different situations.</p>

<h2>Travel and Transportation</h2>

<p>I use <a href="http://tripit.com">Tripit</a> to plan my travel, so was very pleased to see the official Travel app syncs with it automatically.</p>

<p>This is really handy when at an airport; on my way back from Munich I got a flight delay pushed to my wrist while I was eating my currywurst so I knew I didn't need to rush.</p>

<p>This sort of thing makes travel a lot easier. The next step will be boarding cards on the phone, but at the moment only Air Berlin support the Pebble. Surely more will follow.</p>

<p>Another app I've been using <em>way</em> too much is the Transport app's Uber integration. A couple of keypresses gets me a car home, and my credit card is suffering as a result!</p>

<h2>Other apps</h2>

<p>Some other apps I've regularly been using include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Music for changing tracks without getting my phone out of my coat</li>
<li>Swarm for social checkins</li>
<li>Pebbos for controlling my Sonos music system</li>
<li>QuickAuth for doing my 2-factor Authentication for Google, Github etc.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<h2>The Bad Stuff</h2>

<p>OK so there have to be some downsides.</p>

<p>As an iOS user, the biggest problem is that a lot of the Pebble's functionality is crippled due to the lack of APIs on Apple's part.</p>

<p>One example is responding to notifications, on Android each notification can have a number of responses that you can activate on the watch. On iOS the only option is to dismiss the notification and get the watch out of your pocket to reply.</p>

<p>Another example is Voice Replies. This is enabled on Android, but again because of a lack of userland APIs is locked out on iOS.</p>

<p>Hopefully Apple will see the light and offer a way to integrate these functions, but with their own watch as a rival it's unlikely.</p>

<p>Overall the watch still does enough to be worth the cost, but it does make us iOS users feel like second class citizens.</p>

            <link href="/speaking-at-phpuk-2015"/>
            <updated>2015-07-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/speaking-at-phpuk-2015</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was lucky enough to be accepted to speak at PHPUK in February of this year (I am of course writing about it pretty late
on account of my recent return to blogging).</p>

<p>It was my first full-length conference talk, which was pretty cool because PHPUK was the first conference I ever went to,
I think back in 2009. I remember coming back from my first one reeling from the amount of quality talks and community spirit
I'd been exposed to. I've been going most years since, it's generally a high quality conference so I was thrilled to have been picked, especially
to talk in the main room.</p>

<h2>The Talk</h2>

<p>I was particularly impressed with the videos this year. Whoever's doing the AV is doing a cracking job, and they
were all uploaded to YouTube.</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DlgadZLOK-M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h2>Health Problems</h2>

<p>I was speaking on the second day, so I spent day 1 watching talks and generally hanging around the <a href="http://inviqa.com">Inviqa</a> stand
chatting to people. As the day went on, I started to worry because my voice was getting croakier and croakier. By the end of the day I
was finding it hard to get words out so decided to skip the social at a nearby bowling alley (a shame because it looked amazing).</p>

<p>On day 2 I woke up and found I genuinely couldn't speak! I drank a few cups of soothing tea and frantically googled for solutions.
Luckily <a href="https://twitter.com/tonypiper">Tony</a> (who is a chorist so knows such things) was very reassuring on Slack and recommended a particular throat mixture to me
that, as he said, "Tastes like camel piss".</p>

<p>I dutifully gargled and drank the stuff all day and by the afternoon my voice had mostly come back. In the end the talk came out ok,
I think if you know me you can tell I'm struggling but a stranger might just think I had a gruff voice. I didn't stay long at the social
because I could feel it going again.</p>

<p>Over the weekend I consulted a doctor and was told to try not to speak at all. Eventually my voice came back after 3-4 days but it was
a scary experience, especially for someone who's building a speaking career. In the end it was just a random infection so
I'm not too worried.</p>

<h2>The future</h2>

<p><a href="https://joind.in/talk/view/13393">Feedback on the talk</a> has been pretty good and overall I have to say it was a great experience. I'll definitely be submitting
next year!</p>

            <title type="html"><![CDATA[Testing Constructors with PhpSpec 2.3]]></title>
            <link href="/testing-constructors-with-phpspec-2"/>
            <updated>2015-07-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/testing-constructors-with-phpspec-2</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the weekend I tagged the first (hopefully only) beta release of PhpSpec 2.3.0. You can see the <a href="https://github.com/phpspec/phpspec/releases/tag/2.3.0-beta">details of the release here</a></p>

<p>Several of the features relate to constructors, so I thought it was worth going through the differences to how you deal with
constructors when specifying classes.</p>

<h1>Describing construction in 2.2.x</h1>

<p>Since the 2.0 release you have always been able to describe simple constructors:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$this-&gt;beConstructedWith(100, 'param');
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine when describing <code>__construct</code> but a common pattern nowadays is to use Named Constructors. We did not have
a sensible way to describe them until <a href="http://github.com/thecrimpmaster">Jason</a> added a neat syntax for doing this version 2.2.0:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$this-&gt;beConstructedThrough('named', ['Ciaran']);
</code></pre>

<p>This describes a class that has something like the following implementation of a static class:</p>

<pre><code class="php">public static function named($name)
{
    $user = new User();
    $user-&gt;name = $name;

    return $user;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which allows the more readable:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$user = User::named('Ciaran');
</code></pre>

<p>This opened up a lot of possibilities but there were a few issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>The public constructor still existed (Jason's original PR actually handled this but for some reason I got him to remove it).</li>
<li>From observing people using the tool, it became apparent that using an array of parameters caused confusion.</li>
<li>There was no sensible way of testing named constructors throwing Exceptions (e.g. when guarding invariants)</li>
</ol>

<h1>Describing constructors in 2.3.0</h1>

<p>You can now describe named constructors using a shortcut syntax:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$this-&gt;beConstructedNamed('Ciaran');
</code></pre>

<p>This is the equivalent of the case above, without the need to pass the arguments as an array. In short anything matching
<code>beConstructed*()</code> or <code>beConstructedThrough*()</code> are converted to an equivalent <code>beConstructedThrough()</code> call.</p>

<p>The aim of this is to make the specs more readable - the cost is that there is now more than one way of specifying these things.
Time will tell whether this works or not.</p>

<p>Another new addition is that when generating a named constructor, you will be asked:</p>

<pre><code>Do you want me to make the constructor of CLASS private for you? [Y/n]
</code></pre>

<p>When answering yes a private <code>__construct</code> is generated, meaning the named constructor must be used to create instances of the object.</p>

<h1>Describing constructor failure in 2.2.x</h1>

<p>Until now, it's only been possible to test a constructor that throws an exception by explicitly invoking it:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$this-&gt;shouldThrow('InvalidArgumentException')-&gt;during('__construct', ['']);
</code></pre>

<p>This suffers the same problems that <code>beConstructedThrough</code> had - mostly people forgetting to put single arguments inside
an array.</p>

<p>It was vaguely dissatisfying that you tested the constructor by invoking it, and potentially had to repeat the arguments
again, even if you'd called <code>beConstructedWith</code>. Worse, there was no sensible way to specify a static constructor
throwing an argument.</p>

<h1>Describing constructor failure in 2.3.0</h1>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/acasademont">Albert</a> we have a new syntax specifically for describing this sort of exception
that does not care what the construction method used was:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$this-&gt;beConstructedWith(-100);
$this-&gt;shouldThrow('InvalidArgumentException')-&gt;duringInstantiation();
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code class="php">$this-&gt;beConstructedNamed('InvalidName');
$this-&gt;shouldThrow('InvalidArgumentException')-&gt;duringInstantiation();
</code></pre>

<p>For me this is much clearer, and really helps with the clarity of the specs.</p>

<h1>One last thing...</h1>

<p>Something that's bugged me for years is that when PhpSpec generates a constructor method it does so at the end of the
class. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/shanethehat">Shane</a> it's now placed up front in the class!</p>

<p>This is the sort of small change that takes a big effort to implement, so thanks Shane and all the other contributors who've
made this release great.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow, it's been a while! I honestly can't believe it's been nearly 3.5 years since I last wrote a blog post. A few things
have happened in that time:</p>

<ul>
<li>I left <a href="http://themill.com">The Mill / Beam</a> and moved to an awesome job at <a href="http://inviqa.com">Inviqa</a>, where I'm now mostly doing training and coaching</li>
<li>I got involved with, and subsequently took over maintainence of <a href="http://phpspec.net">PhpSpec</a>, a tool I thought was really cool</li>
<li>I started speaking at meetups and conferences (I need to find somewhere on this site to store links to videos)</li>
<li>I got married (gearing up for that was the initial reason I didn't have time to write much)</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, my professional life has changed hugely. I guess I'm now back in a place where I feel I can write longer-form stuff
for a blog.</p>

<p>I keep promising work that I'll write articles for either the Inviqa or Sensio Labs UK sites, so will link out to there when
appropriate, but I wanted to have a place I could dash stuff off without editors being involved.</p>

<p>So, I spent this morning switching the site over to the very cool <a href="http://sculpin.io">Sculpin</a>, and started a few draft posts that I'll be pushing
out in the future. At some point I'll rejig the site's layout so it's a lot easier to find older content.</p>

<p>My aim is to produce 1 blog per month. Will I stick to it? Time will tell...</p>

            <updated>2012-02-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/faster-failing-unit-tests</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the things about unit tests is that if they're going to fail, it's best if they fail quickly.

<p>(This is also a key element of Scrum and other Agile approaches - if you're going to fail, do it as early as possible).

<p>I was listening to <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/2010/09/episode-167-the-history-of-junit-and-the-future-of-testing-with-kent-beck/">this old episode of Software Engineering Radio</a> and in it Kent Beck made the following observations:

<ol>
<li>Ideally you want to run the tests most likely to fail first, so that you get faster feedback
<li>Statistically the most likely tests to fail are the ones that failed recently (i.e. if a test hasn't failed for a while it's less likely to fail next time).
</ol>

<p>This really clicked with me, especially for things like CI, so I knocked up the following hacky script to run my phpunit tests through:

<p><code><pre>
&lt;?php

$run_full = true;

if (file_exists('last_run_report.xml')) {
    
    $failures = array();
    $xml = simplexml_load_file('last_run_report.xml');
    
    if ($res = $xml-&gt;xpath('//error/../@file')) {
        foreach ($res as $file) {
            $failures[] = (string)$file;
        }
    }

    if ($failures) {
        echo 'PREVIOUSLY FAILING TESTS', PHP_EOL;
        echo '------------------------', PHP_EOL;
        passthru('phpunit '.join(' ', $failures), $exit);
        
        if ($exit &gt; 0) { 
            $run_full = false; 
        }
        else {
            echo PHP_EOL;
            echo 'FULL TEST SUITE', PHP_EOL;
            echo '---------------', PHP_EOL;
        }
    }
}

if($run_full){
    passthru('phpunit --log-junit last_run_report.xml');
}
</pre></code></p>

<p>When I use this to run my test suite instead of straight phpunit, it results in a local file called last_run_report.xml being generated. Next time I run the report, if there were any errors, the report is parsed and the failing tests are executed first.

<p>This is <em>really primitive</em> but is already saving me a little time. The next step would be to get a DB involved and maybe log the last few executions of the current suite, to get some stats on how unstable tests have been over the last few executions and prioritise them that way.

<p>I'm sure there's a bunch of other analysis you could do to work out statistically which tests are likely to fail - you could even do some sort of static code analysis and work out which tests have ben potentially impacted since the last test run.

<p>I'll be running this little script locally for now, but with an eye to including it in our CI environment once I've a bit more confidence that it's a valid approach.]]></content>

            <updated>2012-01-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
            <id>/unix-tips-handing-script-output</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow I've not blogged in ages! Here's a couple of quickies that I seem to rediscover every 6 months and promptly forget - hopefully writing them here will make them stick in my head.

<h4>Logging output to disk</h4>

<p>Obviously to log the output of some process to disk you'd normally use <tt>&gt;</tt> or <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt>. However, sometimes you want to also use the output for some other process.

<p>In instances like this you'd use <tt>tee</tt>:</p>

<p><code><pre>
php my-script.php | tee -a /var/log/my-script.log | other-script
</pre></code>

<p>The output of my my-script.php will be both written to my my-script.log, and piped to other-script for further processing (the -a flag means the output is appended to the log rather than it being overwritten).

<h4>Emailing output when something happens</h4>

<p>The <tt>mail</tt> command provides a simple way to mail the output of a script:

<p><code><pre>
php myscript.php | mail -s "A subject line" address@example.com
</pre></code>

<p>However this gets annoying when your script runs every 5 minutes, so more recent implementations of <tt>mail</tt> have a <tt>-E</tt> flag that only sends the mail if the output wasn't empty:

<p><code><pre>
php myscript.php 2&amp;&gt;1 | mail -E -s "A subject line" address@example.com
</pre></code>

<p>In this example the mail will only be sent if myscript.php output something (or an error, the 2&amp;&gt;1 redirects its error output to its standard output).

<p>Unfortunately commenting is currently disabled, so hit me on twitter @CiaranMcNulty if you have any other tips for what to do with output and I'll maybe write a follow-up article.

            <id>/a-great-customer-service-experience-from-amazon</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I got a Kindle around the start of the year, and I guess it's something I could write about separately but I'm fairly sure it's the device I've had that I've got the best entertainment value out of in terms of cost per pound.</p>

<p>If you've seen the ads, you'll come away with the impression that the Kindle can be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLg817U9URM">shoved in a draw, licked by a dog</a> and generally thrown around the place so that's how I treated mine.</p>

<p>Last week I was talking about the Kindle to some workmates and really praised its rugged form and overall resilience - in retrospect it was asking for trouble. The very next morning I took it out of my bag and saw it looking like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ciaranmcnulty/5904816848/" title="Broken Kindle by CiaranJMcNulty, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6011/5904816848_b99d43a2b7.jpg" width="374" height="500" alt="Broken Kindle"></a></p>

<p>My heart sank - what were the odds that Amazon would be able to honour that as a repair? It's fairly clear that it's been knocked around in my bag or something and the screen has failed.</p>

<p>I thought I'd give it a punt anyway and rang Kindle Support. My first experience was not good - the lady on the other end of the line seemed to have trouble understanding me, and took me through a fairly silly 'turn it off and on again' routine. I then got put on hold for a few minutes during which I made <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/CiaranMcNulty/status/88166417123385344">this angry tweet</a>.</p>

<p>However as soon as I got put through to second line support, the whole process was a revelation! Even though I was honest about not having a case and the fact it was clearly damaged from being in my bag, Amazon are sending me a new Kindle immediately which will be here Thursday, after which I have to return the broken one in the box provided.</p>

<p>I felt a bit embarrassed about the tweet so <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/CiaranMcNulty/status/88167696931364865">tried to correct it</a>.</p>


<p>What other hardware companies are this accommodating? Not many I'd warrant so a big thumbs up to Amazon from me. </p>

<p>(Just hope they launch library lending soon in the UK!)</p>]]></content>
