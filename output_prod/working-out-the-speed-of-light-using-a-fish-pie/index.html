    <h2>Working out the speed of light using a fish pie</h2>

    <h3><time>20th April 2009</time></h3>

    <p>Today I brought in some leftover fish pie for my lunch.  I heated it up in our office microwave, but didn't notice that the turntable had slipped off its axis, so the whole thing didn't turn.  When I came to eat the pie, there were hot and cold patches on the top, in a classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_Pattern">interference pattern</a>.  Microwaves always have these hot and cold areas, which is why the turntable is important.</p>

<p class="caption">Sadly the pie disappeared before I could take a picture</p>

<p>My tupperware box is about 20cm across, and the hot patches were about half its width across, so I estimated the distance as 10cm.  The label on the microwave gave the frequency of the magnetron as 2.45GHz. The relationship between wavelength and frequency of a wave is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>wavelength = speed of wave &times; frequency</p>
	
	<p>or:</p>
	
	<p>speed of wave = wavelength &divide; frequency</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So using my observed measurements of 10cm and 2.45GHz, this would give the speed of light as:</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>speed of wave = wavelength &divide; frequency</p>
	<p><span style="visibility:hidden">speed of wave</span> = 10cm &divide; 2.45GHz</p>
	<p><span style="visibility:hidden">speed of wave</span> = 1 &times; 10<sup>-1</sup>m &divide; 2.45 * 10<sup>-9</sup> /s</p>
	<p><span style="visibility:hidden">speed of wave</span> = 1 &times; 10<sup>-1</sup>m &divide; 1/(2.45 * 10<sup>9</sup>) /s</p>
	<p><span style="visibility:hidden">speed of wave</span> = 2.45 &times; 10<sup>8</sup>m/s</p>
	<p><span style="visibility:hidden">speed of wave</span> = 245,000 km/s</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The actual speed of light is more like 299,792 km/s, so I'm in the right ball park but about 18% out.  The source of that error will be my 10cm estimate - working backwards it looks like the actual distance should be more like 12cm. </p>

<p>Anyway, I hope that's piqued your interest, I may try and blog a few more experiments you can do around the office, as they occur to me!</p></section>
