            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A short while back, Google and a bunch of other search engines launched @rel="canonical", a standard for specifying that the current page is a copy of another, more canonical, version hosted elsewhere. <a href="http://ciaranmcnulty.com/blog/2009/02/rel-canonical-should-be-handled-with-care">I blogged about it at the time</a> , and generally approved of the idea but warned against overuse when an HTTP redirect might be more sensible.</p>
  
<p>Recently there's been a large amount of discussion about <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2009/Apr/11/revcanonical/">@rev="canonical"</a> , a proposal that seems to have been floated with the intention of providing <a href=http://revcanonical.appspot.com/ id=zueh title="URL shortening services">URL shortening services</a>. The idea is that my page can 'advertise' some other URLs that it can be found at so that clients can pick a different one to use when referring to it.</p>

<p>In this particular use case I could publish a page at <strong><tt>http://ciaranmcnulty.com/blog/2009-04-14/a-long-blog-post-with-a-complex-url</tt></strong> that had a @rel="canonical" link to <strong><tt>http://ciaran.ws/complex</tt></strong> (I don't really have that domain, don't bother trying it). Applications that wanted a shorter URL for the content (e.g. Twitter clients, SMS gateways) could then use my shorter URL rather than having to get a more obfuscated one from <a href="http://tinyurl.com">TinyURL</a> or somewhere similar.</p>

<p>The number of sites that have already included the markup is staggering in such a short time, and a testament to how a simple markup idea like this can really take off (if only Microformats could gain this kind of uptake!). I've been reading a lot of the commentary that's bouncing around the HTML blogosphere, and thought I'd put my &pound;0.02 in. Frankly, I fail to see the point of all the hooh-hah, for the following reasons:</p>

<h4>@rev is deprecated.</h4>


<p>@rev has been taken out of the proposed HTML5 specification because it's confusing and under-used, so this is probably the worst possible time to start a wide-ranging deployment of a new @rev value. The widespread use will have one of two results, either it'll be completely invalidated when HTML5 is finalised, or the deployment will cause @rev to be put back into the HTML5 spec. Either of these are bad results in my opinion.</p>

<p>The reasons @rev was taken out of the HTML5 proposal are that basically:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Most uses of @rev turned out to be typos of @rel.</li>
  <li>It was pointed that every @rev value could be turned into a @rel just by changing the keyword to indicate a reverse relation, e.g. @rev="parent" and @rel="child" are equivalent.</li>
</ol>

<p>On this basis, a better alternative to @rel="canonical" could be @rel="non-canonical" or something equally trivial - this could also be combined with @rel="alternate".</p>

<h4>Using @rev="canonical" for redirect URLs is wrong</h4>

<p>The idea of @rel="canonical" is to let search engines know that you have duplicate content at other URLs, and which version is the 'correct' one that they should be concentrating on including in their indexes. By that logic, @rev="canonical" should be a list of other URLs at which the same content as the current page exists, but would indicate to a search engine that the current URL is the one that should be used canonically. As an interesting use-case, a search engine could make indexing those URLs low-priority, or just ignore them completely.</p>

<p>However, redirect URLs don't fit in with this usage. They're resources that will redirect to the current one, not resources that contain the same information. The distinction might seem like hair-splitting but I feel it's important that @rel="canonical" is seen as for situations where there are concrete individual pages at differenet URLs.</p>

<p>On a related note, my friend Simon also has some strident opinions about 301 MOVED redirects from URLs that never initially hosted any content that I wish he'd blog about (hint hint!).</p>

<h4>There are better semantics for URL shortening than @rev="canonical"</h4>

<p>OK, so there's probably a use case for saying 'these other URLs have the same content as this page', but nearly all of the discussion has been concentrated on URL shortening.&nbsp; If we're going to use a head LINK to advertise a shorter URL for our content, there has to be a better way than saying 'these other URLs contain the same content' and letting the client check the length of each.</p>

<p>I don't really know what to propose, but something like @rel="shorter-url" or @rel="short-url" or similar would seem to be sensible.&nbsp; Anything's fine as long as it's widespread and gets registered.&nbsp; It'd be nice if someone could knock up an HTML profile for us to use too, but they seem to be on the way out.</p>

<p>Overall, the rev-canonical thing seems to be a fairly simple idea, with a few flaws, that's been overhyped and suddenly implemented everywhere with not much thought going into it.&nbsp; It may well achieve a few things though:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It's got people talking and thinking about @rel values, which is a good thing and might lead to more uptake of technologies like <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/XFN">XFN</a>.</li>
  <li>It's prompted a lot of discussion about HTML semantics, which is a good thing and could help promote <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/posh">POSH</a> and <a href="http://microformats.org">Microformats in general</a>.</li>
  <li>It's shown people how easy it can be to roll out a simple semantic HTML change on a large site, which has to be a good thing.</li>
</ol>

<p>I can only hope that that outweighs all the niggles I have with how rev-canonical is used, and frankly it's currently being used in such a narrow use-case that it doesn't really have a huge impact on the way we use the web.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Something we've been telling clients for years is to not publish the same information in more than one place.  There are many reasons for this from the point of view of web semantics, but the one that makes the clients listen is when we say that Google will penalise their site for it.</p>

<p>As of today Google allow duplicate content as long as you <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/02/specify-your-canonical.html">indicate clearly which version is the canonical one</a>.  This entails adding something like the following to the HEAD element in your duplicated page, pointing back to the original:</p>

<code><pre>&lt;link rel="canonical" href="/the-other-page" /&gt;</pre></code>

<p>This approach has been welcomed by many, but I'm fearful that it is duplicating already-existing web semantics as well as encouraging bad habits in web authors.</p>

<h4>Redundancy, or why it's not needed</h4>

<p>HTTP and HTML already have two mechanisms for dealing with URLs that contain duplicate content:</p>

<h5>Permanent redirects</h5> 

<p>If URLs are exactly equivalent, the server can send a <tt>301 Permanent Redirect</tt> header along with the location of the 'real' content.  This is useful in situations where there's no real reason to present different versions of the same page.</p>

<h5>Content-location headers</h5>

<p>HTTP allows the server to return a content-location header to indicate that the content of the current URL is a duplicate of that at another location.  <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html">RFC2616</a> says:</p>
	
<blockquote>
	The Content-Location value is not a replacement for the original requested URI; it is only a statement of the location of the resource corresponding to this particular entity at the time of the request. Future requests MAY specify the Content-Location URI as the request- URI if the desire is to identify the source of that particular entity.
</blockquote>

<p>... which would seem to duplicate the functionality of rel-canonical with an existing HTTP mechanism.  If authors didn't have access to the HTTP headers their server sent, they could embed it directly in their HTML using the META element:</p>

<p><pre>&lt;meta http-equiv="content-location" content="/the-other-page" /&gt;</pre></p>

<p>I'm therefore not sure why Google have chosen to re-invent the wheel in this way, my only guess would be that <a href="http://www.elementary-group-standards.com/html/html5-http-equiv-difference">HTML5 is largely deprecating http-equiv in META tags</a>. My main concern is that rel-canonical will start to be used in places where a permanent redirect would be more appropriate.</p>

<p>Google don't follow any public processes for recommendations like this, presumably they have some internal debates but a lot of the time these things hit the web fully-formed and are powered forwards via Google's massive market share until other search engines support them.  It's a shame that they don't publish proposals before implementation though, as I'm sure a lot of interested groups would have had some strong opinions to share.</p>

<h4>Where rel-canonical should not be used</h4>

<h5>To fix badly configured webservers</h5>

<p>Poorly configured webservers, or rather servers configured without much thought towards URL semantics, appear be the major source of duplicated content.  In that there's no reasoned plan behind these duplications, it's far better that the developer reconfigure the server properly than to start adding in markup to their documents.</p>

<p>Some misconfiguration examples include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Site available under www.example.com and example.com</strong>.  This is rarely a carefully thought out issue, rather it's often just the server's default behaviour.  The best bet is to pick one subdomain and permanently redirect the other to it.  (It's worth having a look at <a href="http://no-www.org/">no-www.org</a> while you're making the decision).  I can't think of any strong reason for having it available (as in, being served under rather than redirected from) both domains - the site should be served on whatever subdomain you use on your headed notepaper.</li>
	<li><strong>/foo and /foo/ and /foo/index.html all point to the same page</strong>.  Again this is just default behaviour, based on a hierarchical model of websites as folders full of files.  This is easily fixed with a bit of config to redirect all of them to /foo, but it's simple enough for even on a simple site to just standardise on 'missing off index.html in hyperlinks so that the duplicates are never referred to'.</li>
</ul>

<p>In both of these cases, I'd estimate the amount of effort involved in 'fixing' the config to be less than that of each page detecting what URL it's served on and generating an appropriate rel-canonical link.</p>

<h5>To allow chaff in URLs</h5>

<p>I previously wrote about how when a form is submitted the querystring is full of extraneous information, and <a href="http://ciaranmcnulty.com/blog/2008/11/keeping-querystrings-clean-with-zend-framework">how to make the resultant URLs more canonical using redirects</a>.</p>

<p>It would be tempting to do something similar with rel-canonical but <strong>a permanent redirect is appropriate when the two URLs represent the same resource</strong>.  In an example like <tt>/search?size=10&colour=&shape=</tt>, the <em>meaning</em> of both of the requests is 'items that are size 10'.  Therefore it's entirely appropriate to redirect to <tt>/search?size=10</tt>.</p>

<p>Another case worth looking at is when the results of a search are the same as the results of another.  An example might be if the URLs <tt>/search?size=10</tt> and <tt>/search?colour=red</tt> returned the exact same results. This may happen, for instance, if all the red items were only available in size 10.</p>

<p>In this case the two URLs point at clearly different resources ('list of things that are size 10' vs 'list of things that are red'), and the equivalence may change over time.  Therefore it's not something we'd want to do a redirect between - is it an appropriate place for rel-canonical?</p>

<p>Google's definition is a bit quiet on the details of what the exact semantics of rel-canonical are, but more importantly for these kinds of resources it'd be completely impractical to generate a list of which other resources might happen to contain the same list of results at the given time.</p>

<h4>Where rel-canonical should be used</h4>

<p>After all this griping, I can still see some cases where this new semantic might be useful, if we're going to be abandoning the Content-Location HTTP header (or rather, I can think of a few places where content-location would be appropriate that will presumably transfer over).</p>

<p>The commonality between them really is that we don't want to <em>combine</em> the resources, either because we want to slightly vary the way they're presented or because we think that even though they're equivalent at the moment that they might stop being so in the future.</p>

<h5>Presenting resources at different points in a site hierarchy</h5>

<p>A common sort of URL online is: <tt>/red-widgets/widget2000</tt> that contain an identifier for the resource they're looking at as well as some sort of indication of the hierarchy of the site they're in.</p>

<p>Really this sort of slash-separated construction doesn't contain any special meaning it's largely the same as <tt>?category=red-widgets&product=widget2000</tt> except that it contains an implicit hierarchy that hints that you can't have a product identifier without specifying a category.</p>

<p>In a typical application, of course, the page served would contain lots of different contextual stuff such as links to other items in the same category, and maybe some breadcrumbs.  A product may exist in a number of different categories, so we would want to hint that the different URLs were somehow equivalent, without redirecting between them.</p>

<p>Enter rel-canonical, this seems like an entirely appropriate usage to me.  From a resource point of view the page is something like 'widget2000's details in the red-widgets category', which is distinct from 'widget2000's details in the big-widgets category', but their contents are the same and we can hint that using rel-canonical.  Which version is the canonical one I would leave as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<h5>Keeping temporarily-equivalent URLs separate</h5>

<p>This example is from Google's own pages, but is quite a good one.  They quote Wiki type pages, where one wiki entry 'redirects' to another.  The way this is normally handled in Wikis is to not actually do a redirect, but present the same content with a note saying it's a redirect.</p>

<p>Why do this?  Well, the reasoning seems to be that the resources might at some point stop being equivalent, so it's a good idea to keep them separated out.  This would seem to be a reasonable case for a temporary redirect or even a permanent redirect with a short(er) cache header, but in practical terms if the user bookmarks the URL or sends it to a friend, you want them to still have the 'original' URL in their address bar.</p>

<p>This again does seem a reasonable use of rel-canonical, though one I'm less comfortable with.</p>

<h4>Future progress</h4>

<p>I have a few ideas I'd like to see considered for moving this technology forwards:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Adoption of rel-canonical on A elements as well as just HEAD.  A lot of the time (i.e. in the Wiki example) a valid link to the alternate will already exist on the page.  If the @rel could be added on to this rather than having to exist in the head, it would save a bit of effort and keep the markup local to the link.</li>
	<li>Use of this in Microformats, specifically in the field of finding canonical hCards and so on.  There are <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard-brainstorming-autodiscovery">already efforts to do similar things</a>, but if this semantic becomes widespread it's worth adopting.</li>
	<li>Really, a bit more definition of what this @rel value is trying to indicate in terms of REST semantics.  The wording from Google has so far been fairly focussed on what it means practically for search indexing, but it'd be good to see them look at it from a more academic point of view.</li>

            <id>/keeping-querystrings-clean-with-zend-framework</id>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I'm something of a zealot about short, readable URLs.  Most people by now are using server rewrite rules and Front Controllers of some sort to keep the paths in their application sane and legible, but an area that's often overlooked is the querystring, especially after a form submission.</p>

<p>A typical example of a situation with a 'messy' querystring might be a search form on site.  When a form is submitted, all the elements in the form are entered into the querystring whether they're relevant or not.</p> 

<p>That leads to querystrings like <tt>/search?size=&amp;shape=&amp;colour=red&amp;age=</tt>, which would be a lot more legible as <tt>/search?colour=red</tt></p>

<p>On some sites I work with, an 'advanced search form' can have up to 20 elements, all of which might get submitted in one go leaving the search results page with a huge URL.</p>

<p>Aside from an anally retentive need for neatness, the shorter querystrings provide the following benefits:</p>

<ol>
    <li>They are easier to remember.</li>
    <li>They are less likely to wrap when sent in emails.</li>
    <li>The URL is populated with relevant keywords and not the others, so is better for SEO.</li>
    <li>By shortening the URL in this way we ensure there's one canonical URL for every search, which has SEO benefits and can help with aggregating search statistics.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, in the interest of all of the above I've written a Zend Framework Controller Plugin to shorten any GET request that has a querystring.</p>

<p>What is important to note about the plugin:</p>

<ul>
    <li>It takes a flag in its constructor to say whether the redirects used should be permanent or temporary.  This is mainly used for testing.</li>
    <li>The plugin takes effect before any routing is applied, so is about as efficient as a Zend Framework application can be.</li>
    <li>The plugin would be initialised in your bootstrap, by doing <tt>$front->registerPlugin(new Plugin_CleanQuery());</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the source of the plugin, I'm sure the array stuff could be done a bit more efficiently with some combination of <tt>array_filter()</tt> and <tt>array_walk_recursive()</tt> but I'm not convinced it'll be a bottleneck.</p>
