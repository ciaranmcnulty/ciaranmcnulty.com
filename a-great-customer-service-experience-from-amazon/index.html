    <h2>A great customer service experience from Amazon</h2>

    <h3><time>5th July 2011</time></h3>

    <p>I got a Kindle around the start of the year, and I guess it's something I could write about separately but I'm fairly sure it's the device I've had that I've got the best entertainment value out of in terms of cost per pound.</p>

<p>If you've seen the ads, you'll come away with the impression that the Kindle can be <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLg817U9URM">shoved in a draw, licked by a dog</a> and generally thrown around the place so that's how I treated mine.</p>

<p>Last week I was talking about the Kindle to some workmates and really praised its rugged form and overall resilience - in retrospect it was asking for trouble. The very next morning I took it out of my bag and saw it looking like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ciaranmcnulty/5904816848/" title="Broken Kindle by CiaranJMcNulty, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6011/5904816848_b99d43a2b7.jpg" width="374" height="500" alt="Broken Kindle"></a></p>

<p>My heart sank - what were the odds that Amazon would be able to honour that as a repair? It's fairly clear that it's been knocked around in my bag or something and the screen has failed.</p>

<p>I thought I'd give it a punt anyway and rang Kindle Support. My first experience was not good - the lady on the other end of the line seemed to have trouble understanding me, and took me through a fairly silly 'turn it off and on again' routine. I then got put on hold for a few minutes during which I made <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/CiaranMcNulty/status/88166417123385344">this angry tweet</a>.</p>

<p>However as soon as I got put through to second line support, the whole process was a revelation! Even though I was honest about not having a case and the fact it was clearly damaged from being in my bag, Amazon are sending me a new Kindle immediately which will be here Thursday, after which I have to return the broken one in the box provided.</p>

<p>I felt a bit embarrassed about the tweet so <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/CiaranMcNulty/status/88167696931364865">tried to correct it</a>.</p>


<p>What other hardware companies are this accommodating? Not many I'd warrant so a big thumbs up to Amazon from me. </p>

<p>(Just hope they launch library lending soon in the UK!)</p>
