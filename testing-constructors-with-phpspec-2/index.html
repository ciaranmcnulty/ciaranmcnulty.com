    <h2>Testing Constructors with PhpSpec 2.3</h2>

    <h3><time>6th July 2015</time></h3>

    <p>At the weekend I tagged the first (hopefully only) beta release of PhpSpec 2.3.0. You can see the <a href="https://github.com/phpspec/phpspec/releases/tag/2.3.0-beta">details of the release here</a></p>

<p>Several of the features relate to constructors, so I thought it was worth going through the differences to how you deal with
constructors when specifying classes.</p>

<h1>Describing construction in 2.2.x</h1>

<p>Since the 2.0 release you have always been able to describe simple constructors:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$this-&gt;beConstructedWith(100, 'param');
</code></pre>

<p>This works fine when describing <code>__construct</code> but a common pattern nowadays is to use Named Constructors. We did not have
a sensible way to describe them until <a href="http://github.com/thecrimpmaster">Jason</a> added a neat syntax for doing this version 2.2.0:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$this-&gt;beConstructedThrough('named', ['Ciaran']);
</code></pre>

<p>This describes a class that has something like the following implementation of a static class:</p>

<pre><code class="php">public static function named($name)
{
    $user = new User();
    $user-&gt;name = $name;

    return $user;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which allows the more readable:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$user = User::named('Ciaran');
</code></pre>

<p>This opened up a lot of possibilities but there were a few issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>The public constructor still existed (Jason's original PR actually handled this but for some reason I got him to remove it).</li>
<li>From observing people using the tool, it became apparent that using an array of parameters caused confusion.</li>
<li>There was no sensible way of testing named constructors throwing Exceptions (e.g. when guarding invariants)</li>
</ol>

<h1>Describing constructors in 2.3.0</h1>

<p>You can now describe named constructors using a shortcut syntax:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$this-&gt;beConstructedNamed('Ciaran');
</code></pre>

<p>This is the equivalent of the case above, without the need to pass the arguments as an array. In short anything matching
<code>beConstructed*()</code> or <code>beConstructedThrough*()</code> are converted to an equivalent <code>beConstructedThrough()</code> call.</p>

<p>The aim of this is to make the specs more readable - the cost is that there is now more than one way of specifying these things.
Time will tell whether this works or not.</p>

<p>Another new addition is that when generating a named constructor, you will be asked:</p>

<pre><code>Do you want me to make the constructor of CLASS private for you? [Y/n]
</code></pre>

<p>When answering yes a private <code>__construct</code> is generated, meaning the named constructor must be used to create instances of the object.</p>

<h1>Describing constructor failure in 2.2.x</h1>

<p>Until now, it's only been possible to test a constructor that throws an exception by explicitly invoking it:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$this-&gt;shouldThrow('InvalidArgumentException')-&gt;during('__construct', ['']);
</code></pre>

<p>This suffers the same problems that <code>beConstructedThrough</code> had - mostly people forgetting to put single arguments inside
an array.</p>

<p>It was vaguely dissatisfying that you tested the constructor by invoking it, and potentially had to repeat the arguments
again, even if you'd called <code>beConstructedWith</code>. Worse, there was no sensible way to specify a static constructor
throwing an argument.</p>

<h1>Describing constructor failure in 2.3.0</h1>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/acasademont">Albert</a> we have a new syntax specifically for describing this sort of exception
that does not care what the construction method used was:</p>

<pre><code class="php">$this-&gt;beConstructedWith(-100);
$this-&gt;shouldThrow('InvalidArgumentException')-&gt;duringInstantiation();
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code class="php">$this-&gt;beConstructedNamed('InvalidName');
$this-&gt;shouldThrow('InvalidArgumentException')-&gt;duringInstantiation();
</code></pre>

<p>For me this is much clearer, and really helps with the clarity of the specs.</p>

<h1>One last thing...</h1>

<p>Something that's bugged me for years is that when PhpSpec generates a constructor method it does so at the end of the
class. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/shanethehat">Shane</a> it's now placed up front in the class!</p>

<p>This is the sort of small change that takes a big effort to implement, so thanks Shane and all the other contributors who've
made this release great.</p>
