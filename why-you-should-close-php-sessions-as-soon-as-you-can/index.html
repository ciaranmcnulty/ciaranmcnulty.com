    <h2>Why you should close PHP sessions as soon as you can</h2>

    <h3><time>23rd December 2009</time></h3>

    <p>When serving files with PHP, you may notice a curious effect where only one request gets served at a time per user.</p>

<p>You can see it if you're the kind of retro throwback who uses framesets served via PHP - the panels will load in one at a time.  You'll see the same thing if you generate a load of images via PHP - they'll pop up sequentially - and if you serve large video files via PHP like we do at work you may see a curious effect of the downloads queueing up.  Those of you with AJAX applications may be victim to this without realising, but if you're serving JSON/XML responses from PHP scripts you'll find that your parallel AJAX requests will only get served one at a time.</p>

<p>I've seen this effect a few times and always ended up working around it.  The odd thing is this isn't a setting in Apache or a global slowdown of your server. PHP just refuses to serve more than one request per user at a time.  Luckily <a href="http://twitter.com/kevindmorgan" rel="friend">Kevin</a> managed to spot the reason, and it was a new one on me even after 9+ years of using PHP (it's possible everyone else knows about it, mind you).</p>

<p>The answer is pretty simple: <strong>PHP can only handle one response at a time if you have an open session</strong>.</p>

<p>This makes perfect sense when you think about it - when you <tt>session_start()</tt> PHP has to read the data out of the session, then at the end of your script it has to write the data back - if this was happening in parallel then you'd have classic race conditions.  To handle this PHP locks the session on <tt>session_start()</tt> and other pending requests will block until the lock is released.</p>

<p>This leads to some guidelines:</p>

<ol>
<li>Don't start sessions with <tt>session_start()</tt> until you need them (but remember you have to start them before your script output begins).   This would also imply not using session.autostart if you can avoid it.</li>
<li>When serving files via PHP, consider serving them from a different domain so the sessions don't overlap.</li>
<li>End your sessions as soon as you can.  By calling <tt>session_write_close()</tt> you can release your session lock, so as soon as you know your script won't need to write any more to the session, call it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully this will help out somebody in a similar situation in future!</p>
