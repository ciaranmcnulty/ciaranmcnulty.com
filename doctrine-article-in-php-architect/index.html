    <h2>Doctrine article in php|architect</h2>

    <h3><time>27th August 2009</time></h3>

    <p>Ah, fame at last!</p>

 <div class="figure narrow">
    <a href="http://phparch.com/c/phpa/magazine/index"><img src="http://static.phparch.com/common/issues/small/0104.jpg" width="200" height="258" alt="Cover of php|architect"/></a>
    <p class="caption">The latest issue</p>
</div>

<p>It looks like <a href="http://phparch.com/c/phpa/magazine/index">the new issue of php|architect</a> is out, and contains my article about <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/documentation">Doctrine</a>, the PHP-based Object Relational Mapper.</p>

<p>It feels like ages since I wrote it (I'm no longer a 'freelance PHP developer' for a start) so re-reading it was actually a slightly weird experience.</p>
</div>
<p>It's my first published work, and I'm fairly happy with it.  Hopefully I'll get another chance to write for php|architect, I just need to think of another subject that I have something to say about.</p>

<p>The bad news for most of you cheapskates is that php|architect is a subscription-only publication so you can't read my article for free!  However, I would genuinely recommend the magazine, especially as it's only effectively $2.50/issue.  Obviously I wouldn't recommend it for people who aren't interested in PHP, however!</p>
