    <h2>Top 5 Barclays Cycle Hire tips</h2>

    <h3><time>19th October 2010</time></h3>

    <p>It's been a couple of months now since the Barclays Cycle Hire scheme (a.k.a. Boris Bikes) launched here in London. I've used it nearly every day since then and picked up a few tricks along the way. Here are my top five tips for making the most of the scheme.</p>

<h5>1. Get a mobile application</h5>

<p>The main problem with the scheme since  it launched has been the lack of bikes at the docks when you need one, and the lack of spaces when you're out and about.</p>

<p>Having a mobile app that lets you find the docking stations in the move makes a huge difference to how you use the scheme. While on my train to work I can decide whether there are bikes at the three docks near Vauxhall, or stay on the train to aim at one of the five docks near Waterloo.</p>

<p>I have an iPhone and really love the <a href="http://cyclehireapp.com/">Cycle Hire App</a>.  It's completely free, not even ad supported, and the author keeps updating it with more and more features.  I particularly appreciate the preset 25-minute timer that let's you know when it's time to find a dock before you get charged!</p>

<p>My Android-using friends assure me there are apps on the marketplace that are just a good.</p>

<h5>2. Bounce the bike to release it</h5>

<p>Stand near the docking stations in the morning and you'll see hoards of people huffing and puffing trying to tug their bikes out of the docks. However, there IS A BETTER WAY.</p>

<p>When you have your green light, lift the back of the bike about 4-5cm and let it drop, the bike will bounce right out of the dock without any effort on your part.</p>

<p>I was one of the tuggers before I saw someone use this method and now I'm a total convert. </p>

<h5>3. Check the bike before you undock</h5>

<p>So far the bikes I've ridden have mostly been in good nick, and I've certainly not seen many broken ones staying unrepaired, but it's worth giving the bike the once-over before taking it out.</p>

<p>If you undock the bike before you notice something wrong, it can take about 5-10 minutes from the time you put it back before you can take another bike out of the system so it's very important to find any faults first. </p>

<p>The main thing to check is the back wheel. If you do nothing else, do this! Lift the back of the bike and give the wheel a quick spin to check it's spinning freely. Quite a few of the bikes seem to have a lot of friction on the back wheel, possibly due to badly adjusted brakes, and will only turn a couple of times before coming to a complete stop. You should make sure that the wheel can keep spinning relatively freely. You seriously notice the difference after a couple of miles!</p>

<p>Check the pedals are ok, a relatively common fault seems to be someone smashing the kickstand into the pedal and leaving it dangling half off so that it falls off for the unsuspecting cyclist halfway down the road. </p>

<p>Lastly, have a quick check of the handlebar grips. If one is starting to work its way off, the best way to get it back on is to smack it hard on the end with an open hand.</p>

<h5>4. Adjust the saddle</h5>

<p>Learn to use the saddle adjust, I've seen people put their bikes back and press the repair light because they couldn't work out how to stop it dropping down. A complete waste of time for them and for the poor repair teams.</p>

<p>The proper height for the saddle is probably a bit higher than what you expect. Most people shouldn't be able to put both feet on the ground at once. The key is that when you're pedalling you want your legs to be extending fully at the bottom of the rotation, otherwise you're only tiring yourself out.</p>

<h5>5. Be safe</h5>

<p>Not so much a tip, but vital advice. Hire bikes are a fantastic way to get from A to B, but please don't hop on one after 20 years of not cycling and try to make your way along main roads.</p>

<p>Getting comfortable cycling in traffic is something that takes time and experience so it's a good idea to stick to side streets if the last time you got on a bike it had spokey-dokeys on the wheels.</p>

<p>My top safety tips for commuters:</p>

<ul>
<li>Look around you. Lots of the new hire cyclists don't seem to ever look over their shoulder to check if there's a big truck coming before they do a spectacularly dangerous turn. Don't be one of them.</li>
<li>Do hand signals in plenty of time. Just jabbing your hand in the vague direction as you do the turn isn't good enough. If you are one of these people who can't actually control the bike without two hands on the wheel, practice a bit first</li>
<li>Match the speed of traffic. This means keep up with the flow, but also means don't zoom ahead. If you're at a relatively stable speed with respect to the traffic flow everyone knows where you are and can keep track of you. </li>
<li>On the other hand don't push yourself too hard when things get tough, a knackered cyclist is less in control.</li>
</ul>
